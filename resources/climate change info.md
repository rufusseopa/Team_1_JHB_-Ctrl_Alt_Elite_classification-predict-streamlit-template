Climate change can be defined as the ongoing rise of average temperature of our climate system. It is having a negative impact and causing glaciers to melt, sea levels to rise and wildlife are scrambling to keep pace with it. As humans evolve and make advances in manufacturing more heat-trapping gases will be released into the atmosphere. These gases, called greenhouse gases are higher now than at any time in the last 800,000 years.

The result of all of this is called global warming and it is causing a set of changes to the Earth's climate that varies from area to area. While many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, scientists use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems—in part because some areas actually get cooler in the short term.

Climate change encompasses extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. These changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, changing the rhythms of climate that all living things have come to rely on.
