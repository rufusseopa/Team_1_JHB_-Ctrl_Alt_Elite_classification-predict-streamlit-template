A few things noted:

1. It seems like the length for most tweets lie in the `20-120` range in all classes. 

2. The length of tweets for each sentiment class are bell-shaped, and hence have a normal distribution. Since they follow a normal distribution, the mean of the length of tweets can be gauged (which is the highest point on the bell curve).

3. `news` tweets have the lowest mean length. This could be explained by the fact that `news` tweets tend to be concise, and contains just a headline or a link to the full article, hence the length is shorter. 

4. The mean for `anti` tweets are higher than that of `pro` tweets. This could indicate that people may have to use more words to express how climate change is not man-made. This speaks volumes that the general sentiment is leaning more towards `pro` than `anti`, since a few words suffice to explain how climate change is man-made.
